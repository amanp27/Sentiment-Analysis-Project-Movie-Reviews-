# Sentiment-Analysis-Project-Movie-Reviews-
In this project our goal is to find which machine learning model is best suited to predict sentiment (output) given a movie review (input). I have used different Machine Learning models prediction to get the best outcome. I have used CRISP-DM methodology that provides a structured way to plan, organize, and implement a data mining project.
- Here you can notice that we have used different Machine Learning model and algorithms to recognize the pattern in data and make predictions.

- These models can be trained to adapt to individual user preferences and needs. This makes it possible to deliver personalized experiences and targeted recommendations in a variety of areas.
